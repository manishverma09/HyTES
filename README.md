# HyTES
Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer
The Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES) is an airborne imaging spectrometer with 256 spectral channels between 7.5 and 12 micrometers in the thermal infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum and 512 pixels cross-track (https://hytes.jpl.nasa.gov/). 

The scripts here downdload flight information and process Land Surface Temperature from HyTES. Information of individual fight is avialable at JPL's website, but I needed information of all the flights.
